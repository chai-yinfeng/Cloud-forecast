# Cloud-forecast

## Overview

This is a project about cloud forecasting, as my undergraduate graduation program. I will use deep learning method to achieve this goal.
Here are some methods I have accomplished in this repository: ConvLSTM, Unet-like structure, self-attention mechanism, GAN.

I'm very grateful to the open source workers for related work, I get a lot of ideas from their projects, listed below are some of the github repositories I refer to:

## Update

I will update this repository as I make progress in debugging the code.
